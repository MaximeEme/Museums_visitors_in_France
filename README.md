# MUSEUM'S VISITS IN FRANCE 

This is a personal project produced during my free time to demonstrate my personal skills in spreadsheet, R studio and Tableau. 

## Step 1: Ask 

### 1.Ministry of Cultural Affairs   

The Ministry of Cultural Affairs is the main governing body over the 1161 museums in France. 

### 2.Business task 

Analyzing historical data in museum's visits from the Ministry of Cultural Affairs to identify trends and connections between paid and free visits. 

### 3.Key Stakeholders

**Secretary of state**: She is the manager and the director of marketing. She is handling the development of campaigns and the ways to promote the bike sharing program.

**Ministry executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended anlysis. 

## Step 2: Prepare 

### 1.Information on data 

The data has been share publicly by the French's Ministry of Cultural Affairs under strict licence. It is composed of yearly spreadsheets files from 2008 to 2018. The data have been collected from the visists of Museums and it includes the OSM id, name of museum, street number, street, city, postal code, longitude, latidude, stats, label ...

### 2.Limitations of data. 

The data obtained is from 2008 to 2018. I choose to work on ten years worth of data due to the huge amount of data, the analysis can only be judged as a multi-year analysis. As it publicly shared on the ministry's website, I have not doubt on its integrity. 

### 3.Is the data ROCC ?

A good data source is ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.

Reliable - High - It has all the museums that are endorsed by the ministry.

Original - High - It is first-party data. 

Comprehensive - Low - It has been difficult to understand some of the columns. 

Current - Med - The data is 4 year old.

Cited - Med - It is first-party data. 

# Step 3: Process 

I used R to conduct my analysis due to the accessibility of the program, amount of data and being able to create the visualisations.

### 1.Installing packages and library 

```{r}

install.packages("tidyverse")

install.packages("ggplot2")

install.packages("lubridate")

install.packages("janitor")

install.packages("ggpubr")

install.packages("skimr")

install.packages("here")

install.packages("ggrepel")

```

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

library(janitor)

library(here)

library(skimr)

library(ggplot2)

library(lubridate)

```

I chose these packages to help me with my analysis.

### 2.Importing and preparing the data

```{r}

X202004_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202004-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202005_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202005-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202006_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202006-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202007_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202007-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202008_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202008-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202009_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202009-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202010_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202010-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202011_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202011-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202012_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202012-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202101_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202101-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202102_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202102-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202103_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202103-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202104_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202104-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202105_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202105-divvy-tripdata.csv"),

X202106_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202106-divvy-tripdata.csv"), 

X202107_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202107-divvy-tripdata.csv"), 

X202108_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202108-divvy-tripdata.csv"), 

X202109_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202109-divvy-tripdata.csv"), 

X202110_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202110-divvy-tripdata.csv"), 

X202111_divvy_tropdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202111-divvy-tripdata.csv"), 

X202112_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202112-divvy-tripdata.csv"), 

X202201_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202201-divvy-tripdata.csv"), 

X202202_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202202-divvy-tripdata.csv"), 

X202203_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")

X202204_divvy_tripdata <- read_csv("cyclistic spreadsheet files /202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")

```

I also checked the data for inconsistencies in col datatypes. I noticed that some dataframes were wrongly formatted and I had to change that. I did the same code for every tables. 

```{r}

X202102_divvy_tripdata < mutate(X202102_divvy_tripdata, started_at = as.character(started_at), ended_at = as.character(ended_at))

```

### 3.Data cleaning 

I checked the type of each bikes offered and member status of every tables. 

```{r}

n_unique(X202102_divvy_tripdata$rideable_type)

n_unique(X202102_divvy_tripdata$member_casual)

```

> [1] 3

> [1] 2

I checked for duplicated rides in every tables. 

```{r}

sum(duplicated(X202102_divvy_tripdata))

```

> [1] 0

I removed negative time of every tables. 

```{r}

X202102_divvy_tripdata %>% filter(ended_at < started_at) %>% count()

bike_tripdata_202102 <- bike_tripdata_202102 %>% filter(ended_at > started_at)

```

I removed rows with NA values in every tables. 

```{r}

bike_tripdata_202102 <- bike_tripdata_202102 %>% drop_na()

```

I cleaned and formatted the columns names of every tables. 

```{r}

clean_names(bike_tripdata_202102)

bike_tripdata_202102 <- rename_with(bike_tripdata_202102, tolower)

```

I formatted the datetime columns from chr to datetime in every tables. 

```{r}

bike_tripdata_202102 <- bike_tripdata_202102 %>% mutate(started_at = ymd_hms(started_at), ended_at = ymd_hms(ended_at))

```

I merged and renamed the file. 

```{r}

bike_tripdata <- bind_rows (X202004_divvy_tripdata, X202005_divvy_tripdata, X202006_divvy_tripdata,, X202007_divvy_tripdata, X202008_divvy_tripdata, X202009_divvy_tripdata, X202010_divvy_tripdata, X202011_divvy_tripdata, X202012_divvy_tripdata, X202101_divvy_tripdata, X202102_divvy_tripdata, X202103_divvy_tripdata, X202104_divvy_tripdata, X202105_divvy_tripdata, X202106_divvy_tripdata,  X202107_divvy_tripdata, X202108_divvy_tripdata,  X202109_divvy_tripdata, X202110_divvy_tripdata, X202111_divvy_tropdata, X202112_divvy_tripdata, X202201_divvy_tripdata, X202202_divvy_tripdata, 

X202203_divvy_tripdata, X202204_divvy_tripdata)

```

I extracted the day from the started_at column. 

```{r}

bike_tripdata <- bike_tripdata %>%  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE))

```

I extracted the time from the started_at and ended_at columns. 

```{r}

bike_tripdata <- bike_tripdata %>% mutate(start_time = format(started_at, "%H:%M:%S"))%>% mutate(end_time = format(ended_at, "%H:%M:%S")) %>% mutate(start_time = hms(start_time))%>% mutate(end_time = hms(end_time))

```

I extracted the hour from the started_at column.

```{r}

bike_tripdata <- bike_tripdata %>% mutate(hour = hour(start_time))

```

I created a duration column. 

```{r}

bike_tripdata$duration <- difftime(bike_tripdata$ended_at, bike_tripdata$started_at, units = "mins")

```

# Step 4: Analyse 

### 1.Determine the number of member vs casual riders. 

I wanted to determine the number of actual member vs the number of casual riders.

```{r}

table(bike_tripdata$member_casual)

table(bike_tripdata$rideable_type)

```

Casual : 1,763,917

Member : 2,802,582

I plotted the results. 

[Count of users.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950790/Count.of.users.pdf)

From April 2020 to April 2022, the company had more member (customers that pay a membership fee) than casual riders. 

### 2. Number of rides per users and type of bikes. 

Then, I wanted to see the number of rides per users (member and casual) by rides offered (electric, classic and docked bikes) and also the percentage. 

```{r}

bike_percentage <- bike_tripdata %>% select(ride_id, member_casual, rideable_type) %>% group_by(rideable_type, member_casual) %>% count() %>% mutate(percentage = (n/42994*100)) %>% arrange(-percentage)

```

I also plotted the results. 

[Usage of bikes between casual and members riders.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950762/Usage.of.bikes.between.casual.and.members.riders.pdf)

Docked bikes are the go-to bikes from casual riders and member riders. Classic bikes (which are dockless are number 2 in casual but close second for member) and electric bikes are third. Both casual and member seem to like to rely on dock bikes and trust the system to go around. 

### 3. The number of rides per month. 

I wondered which months had the most users. 

```{r}

bike_trip_month <- bike_tripdata %>% select(member_casual, month) %>% group_by(member_casual, month)%>% count()%>% arrange(member_casual)

member_month <-  filter(bike_trip_month, member_casual =="member")

casual_month <-  filter(bike_trip_month, member_casual =="casual")

```

I plotted the results. 

[Number of rides per months of member.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950517/Number.of.rides.per.months.of.member.pdf)
[Number of rides per months of casual users.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950518/Number.of.rides.per.months.of.casual.users.pdf)


May, July and September are casualâ€™s busiest month. It is no surprise to witness spring and summer months being the busiest month for the bike sharing company. The member are again more consistent in their use of the bike throughout the year with May, July and November being the busiest but nine month out of the twelves have at least 200,000 rides which is surprising. 

### 4.Determine the number of rides for each day. 

I wanted to determine which day of the week was the busiest for each type of membership. 

```{r}
bike_trip_weekdays <- bike_tripdata %>% select(member_casual, weekday) %>% group_by(member_casual, weekday)%>% count()%>% arrange(member_casual)

member_weekday <-  filter(bike_trip_weekdays, member_casual =="member")

casual_weekday <-  filter(bike_trip_weekdays, member_casual =="casual")

```
And I plotted the results. 

[Number of rides per days of casual users.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950515/Number.of.rides.per.days.of.casual.users.pdf)
[Number of rides per days of member.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950516/Number.of.rides.per.days.of.member.pdf)

According to the plots, member riders are the most consistent in using the bikes. 5 days of the week exceeding the 400,000 rides in the member category with Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday in the top 3. The casual riders mostly use the bikes on Saturday with roughly 400000 rides. 

The difference between member and casual riders can be explained through the idea of commute + leisure for the member but only for leisure for the casual riders. 

### 5.Getting the number of rides per hour. 

I wanted to be more precise by having the number of rides per hour for each membership.  

```{r}

bike_trip_hour <- bike_tripdata %>% select(member_casual, hour) %>% group_by(member_casual, hour)%>% count()%>% arrange(hour)

member_hour <-  filter(bike_trip_hour, member_casual =="member")

casual_hour <- filter(bike_trip_hour, member_casual =="casual")

```

And I plotted the results.

[Number of rides per hours of member.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950513/Number.of.rides.per.hours.of.member.pdf)
[Number of rides per hours of casual users.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950514/Number.of.rides.per.hours.of.casual.users.pdf)

Member riders mostly use the bike to commute back home with a massive peak of use between 3 pm and 8pm (15h to 20h). The same time slot for the casual riders is the highest peak but canâ€™t be compared to the memberâ€™s usage in term of number. It can be said that member use bikes throughout the day with some consistency to the difference of the casual users that have a growing pattern from 10 am to 3 pm. 

### 6. Mapping of data coordinates of member and casual. 

I thought that it would be a very interesting way to show ride data. I used Tableau to do it using the map graph. 

[Most used bike routes by member.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950452/Most.used.bike.routes.by.member.pdf)
[Most used bike stations by casual users.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950519/Most.used.bike.stations.by.casual.users.pdf)

As the graphs show, Member riders are along the lake-shore and a bit more inland but use more stations overall and have more ride from a station a to a station b. Casual riders on the other hand ride more along the lake-shore and have more ride from station a and return to that same station a. 

### 7.Mean duration and mean duration for member and casual riders. 

```{r}

bike_trip_mean_duration <- bike_tripdata %>% select(member_casual, duration)%>% summarise(mean_duration = mean(duration))

casual_mean_duration <-  bike_tripdata %>% filter(member_casual == 'casual')

casual_mean_duration %>% select(member_casual, duration) %>% summarise(mean_duration = mean(duration))

member_mean_duration <-  bike_tripdata %>% filter(member_casual == 'member')

member_mean_duration %>% select(member_casual, duration)%>% summarise(mean_duration = mean(duration))

mean_duration <- bike_tripdata %>% group_by(member_casual)%>% summarise(mean_duration = mean(duration))

```

And I plotted the results. 

[Mean duration travelled by riders.pdf](https://github.com/MaximeEme/Cyclistic-bike-sharing/files/9950761/Mean.duration.travelled.by.riders.pdf)

I can confirm that the mean duration of a bike trip by casual riders is more than 40 minutes long compared to the 15 minutes of the member riders. it confirmes that the casual riders use the bike for leisure. 

# Step 5: Share phase 

See the graphs throughout this document 

# Step 6: Act phase 

As I said, over the two-year period that I covered (2020/2022), they were more member than casual riders. The member preferred the docked bikes and the classic bike being close second than electrical bikes. 

Member ride more during the week than casual member that ride mostly during the weekend, but casual member have a longer ride duration than member. It can be explained by the fact that member ride to commute to work or to go home while casual ride for leisure. 

Member and casual riders ride more in the evening period, but member also ride a lot during the morning of the work week. 

Recommendations : 

- Plan campaigns to promote the health benefits of using bike to commute to work and the environment benefits. 

- Create an app that could track the activity of riders (i.e. calories burned or CO2 rejections prevented).

- Create partnership with local companies to promote the usage of bike through discount memberships or stations nearby. 

- Increase bikes availability in the top 10 start stations.
